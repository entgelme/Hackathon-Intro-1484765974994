<h1>The toolbox - What should I prepare?</h1> 
At the {hackathon} you probably will create some code, maybe for a
 web or mobile frontend, or for a backend (on Bluemix). You’ll have a 
broad choice of languages and related runtimes, e.g. Java, Node.js, 
Ruby, Go, PHP, Swift, …<br><br>
For the event we expect you to bring your own development machine and 
devices, if needed. You should have installed your favorite development 
environment on your machine (or accessible in the network).<br><br>
In addition, for the access to the Bluemix platform, you should install 
the Bluemix und Cloud Foundry Command Line Interfaces (CLI) prior to the
 event. You can download these components here:<br><br>

<br>
If your communication to the internet has to pass a proxy, here is a description of how to configure that for the CLI: <br>
