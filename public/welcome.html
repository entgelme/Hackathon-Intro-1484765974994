<h1>Welcome to IBM Bluemix</h1>
At the Siemens Hackathon you get the option to realize your solution 
with IBM Bluemix. You can receive free access to this cloud platform, 
and IBM staff will support you at the event and also before. 
IBM Bluemix is a cloud platform for the agile development and operations
 of modern web and mobile apps. You get immediate access to a broad 
range of runtimes and services, which allow for a quick development 
start and subsequent iterative enhancement of your app. With its catalog
 of services, that cover categories like Web, Mobile, Data, Analytics, 
Internet of Things, Cognitive Computing („Watson“) and more, Bluemix is 
the ideal platform for next generation apps.

<h2> IBM Bluemix – how do I get the access?</h2>
You can request your free trial account for IBM Bluemix here:
<a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/"> https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration</a><br><br>

This account provides you the free usage of the runtimes and containers,
 and all IBM services for a period of 30 days. At the end of the period 
you will be notified and have the choice to decide whether the account 
shall be transformed to one of the paid options. Joining a company 
account is one of these options.<br><br>
<b> Please note:</b> we recommend to request the account in advance to 
the event. This will avoid a potential waiting time at the first event 
day until you receive the account activation confirmation.<br><br>

<h2>IBM Bluemix – what can I do with it, and how?</h2>
Prior to the event we offer to join a webinar, where we introduce you to
 the platform IBM Bluemix and selected services. This will also give you
 the chance to ask questions. 
The webinar targets an audience of developers, but of course everybody 
is welcome, maybe just to see what’s in those services and let yourself 
be inspired.<br><br>
The Webinar coordinates:<br><br>

<h2>The toolbox - What should I prepare?</h2> 
At the Siemens Hackathon you probably will create some code, maybe for a
 web or mobile frontend, or for a backend (on Bluemix). You’ll have a 
broad choice of languages and related runtimes, e.g. Java, Node.js, 
Ruby, Go, PHP, Swift, …<br><br>
For the event we expect you to bring your own development machine and 
devices, if needed. You should have installed your favorite development 
environment on your machine (or accessible in the network).<br><br>
In addition, for the access to the Bluemix platform, you should install 
the Bluemix und Cloud Foundry Command Line Interfaces (CLI) prior to the
 event. You can download these components here:<br><br>
