<h1>IBM Bluemix Webinar</h1>
Prior to the event we offer to join a webinar, where we introduce you to
 the platform IBM Bluemix and selected services. This will also give you
 the chance to ask questions. 
The webinar targets an audience of developers, but of course everybody 
is welcome, maybe just to see whatâ€™s in those services and let yourself 
be inspired.<br><br>
The Webinar coordinates:<br><br>
