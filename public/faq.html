<h1>Hackathon with IBM Bluemix - FAQ</h1>

<ul>
	<li> <b><a>I need some test data from our backend systems. How can I integrate that with my app?</a><br><br>
	Answer:</b> although there are services on Bluemix, which especially 
support the secure integration with on-premise systems, we do not 
recommend to use them for the hackathon. The integration concept has to 
be discussed with and approved by people in your company, who are 
responsible for network administration, security, etc. This may take 
some time. 
	If possible, itâ€™s a better approach to export data, e.g. to a csv file 
and import that again into a database service on Bluemix. Please make 
sure, that the data is uncritical, i.e. does not violate security or 
sensitive personal data rules of your company or country.
	In case of questions, please contact us. We will be happy to help you 
with the setup.<br><br></li>
 
	<li><b><a>I had a Bluemix Trial Account before, but it has expired in the meantime. What shall I do now?</a><br><br>
	Answer:</b> the Trial Accounts expire after 30 days and the IBMID is 
blocked after this period of evaluation. In regard to make IBM Bluemix 
	available to all participants, we would like to reactivate those 
expired accounts on notice by you! Therefore, please let us know if you 
	want to use Bluemix again! 
 
 
For reactivation of your account and for all other questions around the 
IBM sponsoring at the Siemens Hackathon, please feel free to get in 
touch with Jakob Boehm (jakob.boehm@de.ibm.com, +40/16098976670).
	Just refer to your Bluemix account name, so we can reactivate your 
account once.</li>
